# Step Count and Music Listening Behavior Analysis

## 1. Dataset Description

### **Step Count Data**
- **Source**: Apple Health step count records.  
- **Scope**: Daily step counts and associated timestamps.

**Details**:  
The data captures the total number of steps taken each day, serving as a proxy for physical activity and outdoor movement.

### **Spotify Listening Data**
- **Source**: Spotify dataset.  
- **Scope**: Spotify listening history.  

**Details**:  
The data includes the total number of songs listened to each day and the total listening duration (in minutes).

## 2. Project Objective

To explore the relationship between the amount of physical activity (measured through step counts) and music listening behavior (measured through Spotify data).  

**Key Research Question**:  
Can daily step counts serve as an indicator of time spent listening to music on Spotify?

## 3. Project Plan

### **Phase 1: Data Collection**

- **Step Count Data**:  
  - Extract daily total step counts and timestamps from Apple Health step count records.

- **Spotify Data**:  
  - Gather daily listening history, including the total number of songs and total listening time (in minutes).

---

### **Phase 2: Data Preprocessing**

- **Merge Datasets**:  
  - Align step count data with Spotify listening history by matching date fields.  

- **Data Cleaning**:  
  - Address missing or inconsistent data in both datasets.  
  - Normalize metrics (e.g., steps and listening time) for consistent analysis.

---

### **Phase 3: Analysis and Modeling**

- **Relationship Analysis**:  
  - Examine correlations between daily step counts and music listening behavior.  
  - Investigate whether higher step counts correspond to more music listening time.  

- **Behavioral Modeling**:  
  - Develop predictive models to estimate physical activity levels based on music listening data.  

- **Visualization**:  
  - Create visual representations to highlight trends, such as step counts versus listening time or music genre preferences at different activity levels.

---

### **Phase 4: Findings and Deliverables**

- **Insights**:  
  - Provide a detailed analysis of the relationship between physical activity and music listening.  

- **Visual Reports**:  
  - Present clear graphs and visualizations showcasing trends, correlations, and key findings.
